# discord-conversation-bot
Discord does not provide support for bots in conversations (DMs). Here is a script I wrote as an attempt to have a bot-like command system in Discord conversations.

If you would like to try it out, make sure the TARGET_M_POS constant is set to where your own mouse position is when hovering over the far-left side of a discord message. This is the position in which you mouse triple clicks for the copy-paste sequence.


# Commands
Currently the only command (rank!) returns the rank of a League of Legends player in NA.
